									<h2><strong>FPS Blockout</strong></h2>
									<p>This was an university project where the goal was to design a map for Counter Strike. The level was made using probuilder in Unity.
									The main point was to design a level taking specially into account the pacing and the time each team would require to reach the choke points.
									Apart from that, the level also tries to offer both teams multiple paths focused on different types of gameplay (different types of ranges, different ammounts of covers etc.)
									</p>

									<p>
									As i mentioned earlier the main focus was pacing and timing. Having that in mind i design each path taking into account the fact that the defenders should reach the bomb points a little earlier than the attackers, giving them a moment to prepare for the incoming enemies.
									Also i tried to give both teams multiple paths. There are three critical paths that go from the spawns to the main chokepoints and also some secondary path that try to give other options to the players.								
									</p>
									<p>
									Even though i feel like i achieved the main goal of the project, there are some things that could have been better:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>In the first place, i feel that the some of the areas (specially the open area on the left) are not really suited for a game like Counter Strike. There is too much open space without cover wich could be better suited in other FPS with faster movement like Call of Duty.</li>
										<li>In second place, i feel that even though the chokepoints are okey, the rest of the paths are maybe too bland.</li>
										<li>Finally, even though it is a blockout, i believe the presentation of the level is a bit rough.</li>
									</ul>

								<section id="second">
									<h2><strong>Visual Guide</strong></h2>
									<p>This was an university project where we received a level as a starting point and then apply changes to the level following some general guidelines. 
									Without changing the main structure we had to make the player focus on certain places and follow a specific path until it reach the end. We also had to make sure the player would feel certain emotions in different steps of the level.
									</p>


									<p>
									This was a very interesting exercise where instead of focusing on the main layout of the level, I had to look closely and focus on the details, using shapes and colors to make sure the player would look where i wanted them to look.

									<h2><strong>Metroidvania</strong></h2>
									<p>This was the final project for my Level Design course during college. The goal was to make a Metroidvania where we could apply the different techniques and methods we learnt during the course (such as kishotenketsu or trying to present different situations with ABC distribution etc.)
									</p>
									
									<p>
									Down here you can see the map and a graph explaning how each upgrade is obtained.
									The goal is to collect the 4 main upgrades to open the door to the final zone. There are also 2 optional powerups that make the game easier to play or open up other paths.
									Additionally, there are 13 optional collectibles scattered around the map that serve as the equivalent as extra ammo or health in Metroid.
									(PW = Powerup, PW yellow = Optional Powerup, TP= Teleport room)

									<p>
									Although i spent a great deal of time and effort and i genuinely believe there are great things about this project, i have also need to address it's main issue.
									<br>
									Due to the backtracking and the multiple paths presented in a Metroidvania it is crucial that the player can identify where they are and where they should go. I took this into account when i designed the interior of each room, making sure that no two rooms were alike in terms of obstacles, enemies, challenges etc. I also used different assets for each zone so they would be easier to differentiate.
									<br>
									However i didn't apply this to the shape of the room itself. This caused that when the player look at the minimap most of the rooms looked the same because the minimap doesn't show the interior of the rooms.
									<br>
									Other than this issue, i believe that the overall design, the pacing and the encounters are designed well enough so they can compesate this mistake that i'm certain i won't make again.

									</p>

									Here are some pictures of the map and some of the different zones.

									<h2><strong>Level Design Document</strong></h2>
									<p>Finally, in this last project we had to pick a game and make a document where we explained the design of a fictional level, so that another person would implement it as a blockout.

									In my case I designed a level for Persona 5:
									</p>

									<p>
									-First I researched the levels of the game, looking for common concepts and also searching for ideas that were left unused or could be developed further. In this search i noticed that most of the levels where interiors and there was only one level that had an open area but was only use for a brief moment.
									With this in mind i decided to pick a setting where i could present both an interior area and an open air area. 
									I decided to design a level where the player would start in a forest that would eventyually lead to a japanese medieval castle. I also took noticed of the different camera shots the game used to make the heist look spectacular and tried to implement some spaces where i could maximize this cinematic effect.
									</p>

									<p>
									This would be the layout of the open area. 
									</p>

										</a>
									</center>
									<br>
									<br>

									<p>
									The interior of the castle would be more similar to the rest of the levels in the game. It would have multiple puzzles that would need to be solved in order to advance in the level.
									</p>

										</a>
									</center>
									<br>
									<br>

									<p>
									-Apart from the layouts i also made some charts to look into the elements of the level and the expected pacing of the level
									</p>

									</a>

									<br>
									<br>

									<p>
									-Finally I made a visual scheme how each area of the level should look and feel.
