									<h2><strong>FPS Blockout</strong></h2>
									<p>This was an university project where the goal was to design a map for Counter Strike. 
									The main point was to design a level taking specially into account the pacing and the time each team would require to reach the choke points.
									A part from that, the level also tries to offer both teams multiple paths focused on different types of gameplay (different types of ranges, different ammounts of covers etc.)

									<p>
									As i mentioned earlier the main focus was pacing and timing. Having that in mind i design each path taking into account the fact that the defenders should reach the bomb points a little earlier than the attackers, giving them a moment to prepare for the incoming enemies.
									Also i tried to give both teams multiple paths. There are three critical paths that go from the spawns to the main chokepoints and also some secondary path that try to give other options to the players.								
									
									
									Even though i feel like i achieved the main goal of the projects, there are some things that could have been better:
									-In the first place, i feel that the some of the areas (specially the open area on the left) are not really suited for a game like Counter Strike. There is too much open space without cover wich could be better suited in other FPS like Call of Duty.
									-In second place,

									<h2><strong>Visual Guide</strong></h2>
									<p>This was an university project where we received a level as a starting point and then apply changes to the level following some general guidelines. 
									Without changing the main structure we had to make the player focus on certain places and follow a specific path until it reach the end. We also had to make sure the player would feel certain emotions in different steps of the level.
									</p>


									<p>
									This was a very interesting exercise where instead of focusing on the main layout of the level, I had to look closely and focus on the details, using shapes and colors to make sure the player would look where i wanted them to look.

								<section id="third">
									<h2><strong>Metroidvania</strong></h2>
									<p>This was the final project for my Level Design course during college. The goal was to make a Metroidvania where we could apply the different techniques and methods we learnt during the course (such as kishotenketsu or trying to present different situations with ABC distribution etc.)
									Although i spent a great deal of time and effort and i genuinely believe there are great things about this project, i have also need to address it's main issue.

									Due to the backtracking and the multiple paths presented in a Metroidvania it is crucial that the player can identify where they are and where they should go. I took this into account when i designed the interior of each room, making sure that no two rooms were alike.
									However i didn' apply this to the shape of the room itself. This caused that when the player look at the minimap most of the rooms looked the shame because it doesn't show the interior.

									A part from that main issue, i believe that the overall design, the pacing and the encounters are designed well enough so they can compesate this mistake that i'm certain i won't make again.

								<!--Level Design Document-->
								<section id="forth">
									<h2><strong>Level Document</strong></h2>
									<p>Finally, in this last project we had to pick a game and make a document where we explained the design of a fictional level, so that another person wold implement this level.

									In my case I designed a level for Persona 5 and to design the level i first researched the .

									-I researched the levels of the game, looking for similar concepts but also ideas that were left unused. In this search i noticed that most of the levels where interiors and there was only one level that had an open area but was only use for a brief moment.
									With this in mind i decided to pick a setting where i could present both an interior area and an open air area. 
									I decided to design a level where the player would start in a forest that would eventyually lead to a japanese medieval castle. I also took noticed of the different camera shots the game used to make the heist look spectacular and tried to implement some spaces where i could maximize this cinematic effect.


									Here is the document itself, unfotunately right now is only available in spanish.
