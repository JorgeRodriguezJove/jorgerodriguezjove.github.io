								<!--Intro-->
								<h3 class = "major">PROJECT SUMMARY</h3>

								<p>
									"Duality" is a custom map made for Doom 2. Originally, I was going to make this map for a game jam from Steve Lee about nonlinearity but I didn't have the time at that moment so I've decided to do it now. 
								</p>

								The main idea is:
								<ul>
										<li>At the beginning of the level, the player takes either the left or right path.</li>
										<li>Each path leads to a key and activates a trap that affects the whole map.</li>
										<li>No matter which order the player takes, the second path will always be harder than the first.</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Left side lowers pillars that have enemies and items.</li>
											<li>Right side opens vents in the ceiling and floor with enemies, items, and lava pits.</li>
										</ul>
										
								</ul>

								<h3 class = "major">DESIGN PROCESS</h3>

								<ol>
										<li>Brainstorming and writing ideas, possible issues, elements to use, and goals of the level</li>
										<li>Drawing a rough sketch of the initial layout</li>
										<li>First implementation in the editor. The level can already be played from start to finish.</li>
										<li>Multiple iterations in the editor. Focus on getting the shapes and the overall progression right.</li>
										<li>At this point, I playtest with other people and iterate based on the feedback and issues I can find by watching them play.</li>
										<li>Final tweaks, polishing, and publishing the level.</li>
								</ol>

								<p>1.First, I started by setting clear goals for the map and deciding the core mechanics and main concept.
								I also wrote all the possible ideas and issues I could find and also describing the sequence of the level as I initially imagined it.  
								</p>

								<p>2.With these notes in mind, I moved to Photoshop and did a quick and rough sketch. At this stage, I just want a basic top-down to translate into the editor
								</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Initial Sketch.png" alt="" /></span>

								<!--
								
								<ul>
										<li>Basic interactions (doors, switches, elevators)</li>
										<li>Walls with windows (To show key aspects of the map)</li>
										<li>Pillars that lower and have enemies and other elements (Effect of left path)</li>
										<li>Sliding vents in the floor and ceiling with lava and enemies (Effect of right path)</li>
								</ul>
								
								
								<p>Everything was working except for the sliding doors with the lava. 
								Due to my lack of familiarity with the engine, I quickly realized that this wasn't as straightforward as the previous stuff. 
								After some research, I found a way to achieve this by using an updated version of the editor that allows for 3D floors + writing my own scripts to make the vents move down. 
								While I was researching how to solve this issue, I was already thinking of other possibilities to make the map work but thankfully it didn't reach that point.
								</p>

								-->

								<p>3 & 4 After solving some initial problems and making sure that the main mechanics were working, I focused on making that initial layout playable in the editor as soon as possible.
								At this stage, the enemies and items are placeholders, and I’m focussing on getting the sequence and progression of the level right. 
								</p>

								<!--
								BREAKDOWN DEL NIVEL
								-->
						
								<p>Once the level was working, I started doing some playtests with friends. Quickly I realized that I had two main problems:
								</p>

								
								<ol>
										<li>The first time players travel through the area (yellow line) they don't pay attention to the pillars because they don't stand out as important elements.</li>
										<li>The button that lowers the pillars is in the middle of a room creating an ambush. Players associated the button with that ambush in particular and didn't think of the pillars outside that room.</li>
										<li>When the players go back to the previous rooms (end of the blue line) they don't understand that they have already been here. The room is not recognizable enough + they don't realize that the enemies are new due to the pillars being down.</li>
								</ol>


								<div class="ImageUnderText">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Analysis.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Old version of the left path</p>
								</div>


								<p>The problem with the pillars came down to players not noticing the different textures before activating the switch + thinking that the pillars were only a thing for the button room.
								I tried multiple things before changing the textures but it wasn’t enough.
								I kept trying to use the same texture because it fit better with the overall visual style of the level, but in the end, I decided that it was best to go for something more dramatic that would surely catch the player's attention.
								</p>

								<div class="ImageUnderText">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Analysis.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Comparison between old pillars and final</p>
								</div>

								<p>The problem with the confusion on the way back was easier to address.
								I created a new room and tried to make it stand out so it could work as an anchor in the middle of the path.
								To do that I created a round room with distinct textures and lightning to make it stand out by using new shapes, colors, and lightning.
								I decided also to move the super shotgun to this spot and place a Cacoon demon (which I’m using as harder enemies) to make it as memorable as possible for the player (it also has the bonus of leaving a corpse which will make the player realize that they were already here).  
								</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Analysis.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Final state of room where the path loops back</p>
								</div>


								<p>With these two things in mind, I remade the left side (while trying to throw away as little as possible) And after some final playtests and tweaks I decided it was time to stop iterating on it and called it finished.

								<h3 class = "major">RETROSPECTIVE</h3>

								<p>As a general idea, I think the concept works really well. Not only works as a way to dynamically adjust the difficulty as the player progresses through the levels but also incentivizes the player to replay the level and try it in the opposite order.
								There are however some things that are not working as well as they could:
								</p>

								<ul>
										<li>Paths could be more unique. This is mainly because it's my first time doing a Doom map and I don't really know the limitations and possibilities of the engine but I feel that the pillars and the vents are very similar. Both change the level in a vertical way and show enemies and items. My personal opinion is that they are different enough for it to work, but I would like to explore the concept again in the future with more different challenges and more drastic ways to change the map.</li>
										<li>One problem that I found with my approach to this idea is that hunting for secrets is tedious. When players have played both paths and have opened the doors, if they decide to return to the first path to search for the secrets that they missed due to the second path being inactive, they are going to backtrack with almost no engagement. In the best case, they are going to find a few enemies that don't really present a challenge on their own (as they were meant to be fought with the original enemies of that path). In this case, this is very obvious in the left path which doesn't add new enemies when the vents from the second path are opened.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Leaving those problems aside, one of the things that surprised me the most was how hard was to convey to the players how the left path worked. The vents on the right path are very "gamey" and obvious so all of the testers quickly understood that they were a trap. The pillars however didn't stand out at all for any of the initial testers (and even when the trap  had already been activated some of them didn't fully realize that it was something general in the map). I was already aware that I was biased and that my judgment  on this wasn't to be trusted, even though they looked obvious to me I knew that it was because I was already aware of how they worked. Fortunately, I could ask enough people to play the game to make multiple iterations and improve the chances of players understanding how it works and the latest playtests showed this improvement which was really great to see.</p>

								
								<p>With all that said, it was really fun to work on the project and it was also very different to what I'm used to. The Doom editor was a bit weird to figure out initially, but in the end, I found myself going through the level and doing rooms at a very fast pace which was very rewarding.
								Now that the map is done I'll move to a different project but I may come back to Doom to make more maps in the future</p>
